Game of Drones *training camp*
============================

This page reproduce the rules of the [codingames challenge](http://www.codingame.com/cg/#!challenge:parrot) .

I made it for JavaScript developpers who wants to access theirs precious debug tools for the challenge.

Usage
=====

Complete the init and run function at the end of the file with your IA.

The init function is called at start. As in the regular codingames IDE, readline will give you the inital values.

The run function is called at every frame. It differs from the regular IDE because there is no need to create an infinity loop. Except for that, every things are similar ( readline and print function do the same thing ).




The game pause on every frame, you can set on fly the destination of the player which are not controled by your IA with drag & drop.

Hit the space bar to go one step futher.
